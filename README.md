Title

Video Game Sales Analysis Tool
Description

This Python script provides an interactive tool to explore and analyze video game sales data from a CSV file. Users can choose between:

Data Frame Questions: Analyze the data using various options, including finding the best-performing regions/platforms/genres/publishers/years, identifying top/worst-selling games, and exploring specific regions like NA.
Visual Data Representations: Create various plots and charts to visualize the data trends, such as sales trends, platform sales, genre sales distribution, sales comparison by genre and platform, rank vs. global sales, rank vs. game names, and global sales comparison by genre, platform, and year for a specific publisher.
Features

Data import and preprocessing from CSV files (using pandas)
Data analysis and calculations (e.g., finding best-performing regions, top/worst sales)
Data visualization with various plot types (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, using matplotlib and plotly)
User interaction for controlling data analysis and visualization options
Usage

Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
Install required libraries: Make sure you have pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and plotly.express installed (pip install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly.express).
Place your CSV file in the same directory as the Python script (vgsales1.csv in your example).
Run the script: Execute the Python script (e.g., python video_game_sales_analysis.py).
Follow the prompts: The script will guide you through choosing between data frame analysis and data visualization, and then specific options within each category.
